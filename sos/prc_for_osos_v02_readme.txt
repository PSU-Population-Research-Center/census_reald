Notes

The associated data files contain demographic analysis and data for the purposes of
research and planning for service delivery and in support of needs under HB3021 and other
public policy purposes, developed in collaboration with the Oregon Secretary of State and 
the Oregon Health Authority.

The data include estimated population counts for languages spoken at the state and county
level for Oregon counties and Clark County, WA. Languages listed are consistent with the 
4-digit code system used by the US Census Bureau since 2016, and which is closely related
to the ISO 639-3 classification. The Census Bureau aggregates or combines many 4-digit 
codes in its public products, including the Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) and tables 
B16001 and C16001. Where possible, the results are published at the same level of detail
as in the PUMS. Further revisions may be made in the future to accord to Oregon REALD 
language classifications, as they are developed by the Oregon Health Authority.

Starting in 2016, the Census Bureau made significant revisions to the

Tabulations made from ACS PUMS have been made consistent with published ACS detailed 
tables at the county level by adjustment of the ACS PUMS weights, through an iterative 
process to optimize for values for the weights that produce results that are acceptably
close in accuracy to multiple published county totals by characteristics. Totals may 
differ from data in published ACS tables or from ACS PUMS calculations with unadjusted 
person or household weights due to the nature of the optimization process. ACS tables 
used in the raking process include: B01001; B01001A-I; B03001; B10056; B10059; B11005; 
B11001; C16001; C17002; B16004; B16009; B17024; B17020A-H; B18101; B18131; B19057.

The reweighting process results in non-integer counts, and these have been left as is. 
They can be displayed as rounded to whole integer counts. Rounding errors may results in 
totals that do not sum exactly. Standard errors for counties other than Clackamas, 
Douglas, Deschutes, Jackson, Lane, Marion, Multnomah, and Washington counties are 
experimental and should be interpreted with caution. Missing data should be interpreted 
as zeros, and missing standard errors mean that there were insufficient data to calculate 
standard errors.

Total population includes households and group quarters; therefore, totals for family or 
other types of households will not sum to the total population. Totals by living 
arrangements, e.g. presence of children or living alone include households only. Not all 
households have reported income or a poverty status; therefore, sum of population by 
household income quintiles or income to poverty ratio will not sum to total population. 

Disability status is assessed only for the civilian noninstitutionalized population; 
therefore, sums across disability status will not sum to total population. 
Institutionalized in this context refer to facilities that house those who are primarily 
ineligible, unable, or unlikely to participate in the labor force while residents, and
civilian refers to non-military personnel.

Language and English proficiency are assessed for the population age 5+ only. 

REALD race/ethnicity are assigned using experimental heuristics and then adjusted for 
consistency at the county level by OMB race/ethnicity only. REALD method assigns a primary
race, which is not a feature of the ACS. Primary race is assigned using the "Rarest race"
principle, which selects a primary race for multiple race persons by using the least 
populous category accoriding to the equivalent OMB race. Approaches are under ongoing 
development and results may not match totals published elsewhere or at a later date.

Same sex cohabiting couples controlled to the county totals from the 2020 Census 
Demographic and Housing Characteristics (DHC) file, not the ACS, due to insufficient 
geographic detail in the ACS.

Rural/urban population counts determined by tract-level population counts by RUCA codes. 
Urban population is counted from tracts with codes 1--3 and rural from codes 4--10. RUCA
codes for 2020 census tracts have not been determined. Therefore, RUCA codes for the 
purpose of urban/rural determination are assigned to 2020 tracts according to the overlaid
2010 tract that best approximates the boundaries of the 2020 tract using population-
weighted tract centroids.
