# Background/SOW
OHA needs to generate county-level population estimates by race, ethnicity, language,
and disability status in accordance with Oregon REALD reporting standards, including
additional race/ethnicity detail beyond those available in data from the US Census
Bureau. To meet these needs, OHA has developed methods for assigning REALD race
categories to records in the American Community Survey (ACS) PUMS. Agency will
produce annually updated data at the county level for race/ethnicity, home language,
English proficiency, disability, age, and binary sex.
As the REALD standards and implementation are in active continuous development,
Agency will follow guidance on REALD definitions from OHA. Agency will use OHA
provided code to assign REALD race and ethnicity classification to the ACS PUMS.
Agency will use available data on distribution of proxy populations at a more granular
level to downscale PUMA estimates from PUMA level for the county levels for Oregon
counties and Clark County, WA. Agency will calculate the frequency of each Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) and REALD race and make the assignment from
multiple to a single race for multi-race persons on the basis of rarest race (Mays et al.
2003). Agency will use poststratification weighting techniques to adjust population sizes
from downscaled tables to accord to county population totals, when known from other
authoritative sources, e.g., the ACS 100% Summary Files (SF).

Agency will share all code and data with the OHA REALD & SOGI unit and will
develop and host a website where data and methodology are posted and publicly
accessible. Releases shall be updated after each release of a new 5-year ACS PUMS file.
PSU will also work on producing historic PUMS estimates, with 2017-2021 as first set of
5-year PUMS county REALD estimates and will work on producing ACS 2016-2020 and
ACS 2015-2019 county REALD estimates, before ACS 2018-2022 PUMS release.

Agency shall perform the following tasks which may be one time or on an
ongoing basis:
(1) Develop REALD population county level estimates (within 3 months after
PUMs release annually) utilizing the following:
(a) Use ACS microdata records to assign REALD classifications using
code developed by OHA;
(b) Collect and prepare GIS, census, and other population and
supplemental data, to identify appropriate proxy populations from
other datasets for downscaling ACS PUMS estimates;
(c) Downscale ACS PUMS estimates by REALD from PUMA to
county level for counties in Oregon and for Clark County, WA;
(d) Apply rarest race method to make primary race assignments;
(e) Produce the following county level estimates for each age group
of: total population, age 5+, age 0-64, age 18-64, age 65+:
i. Disaggregated (most detailed) race/ethnicity and aggregated
race/ethnicity (rarest race);
ii. Disaggregated disability status and aggregated disability
status;
iii. Binary sex;
iv. English proficiency and limited English proficiency;
v. Disaggregated (most detailed) language spoken at home
(f) Produce state level estimates utilizing the criteria in 3.a.(1) a.
through e. above, for the age groups of: 0-14, 15-17, 18-19, 20-24,
25-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60+.
(g) Consult with and follow guidance from OHA regarding application
of methods and interpretation of data standards;
(h) Update results within 3 months upon subsequent annual releases of
new 5-year ACS PUMS.
